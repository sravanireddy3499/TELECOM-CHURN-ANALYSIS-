# End-to-End Churn Analysis Portfolio Project

## Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses, as retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project focuses on performing an end-to-end churn analysis to identify key factors influencing customer churn and develop predictive models to mitigate it.

## Objectives
- Understand customer churn patterns using exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for churn prediction
- Interpret model results to provide actionable business insights
- Deploy the predictive model for real-world application

## Dataset
- **Source:** [customer data - kaggle]
- **Description:** The dataset contains customer demographics, service usage, contract details, and churn labels.
- **Features:**
  - Customer ID
  - Demographics (Age, Gender, etc.)
  - Account information (Contract type, Tenure, Payment method, etc.)
  - Service usage (Internet service, Streaming, etc.)
  - Churn label (Yes/No)

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - Load dataset and handle missing values
   - Perform data type conversions and outlier detection

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize churn distribution
   - Identify key features affecting churn
   - Correlation analysis

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Scale numerical variables
   - Create new features if needed

4. **Model Building & Evaluation**
   - Train multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, )
   - Use performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC
   - Interpret model results using SHAP/LIME

5. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Save the trained model
   - Develop a simple API or web interface for real-time churn prediction

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Random Forest Library 
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Insights & Business Recommendations
- Identify customer segments with high churn risk
- Suggest targeted retention strategies based on model insights
- Provide recommendations to improve customer experience and engagement

## Future Enhancements
- Use advanced deep learning models for better accuracy
- Incorporate additional customer interaction data for improved predictions
- Implement real-time monitoring and alerts for churn risk

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a structured approach to churn analysis, integrating data science techniques to provide actionable business insights. The results can help businesses make informed decisions to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
